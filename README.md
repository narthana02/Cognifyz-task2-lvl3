Task: Votes Analysis

Identify the restaurants with the highest and
lowest number of votes.

Analyze if there is a correlation between the
number of votes and the rating of a
restaurant.

Inference:
Identifying Restaurants with Highest and Lowest Votes:

The highest_votes_restaurant and lowest_votes_restaurant DataFrames will contain the restaurant(s) with the highest and lowest number of votes, respectively. Correlation Analysis:

The heatmap will show the correlation between the number of votes and the rating. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive correlation, and if it's close to -1, it indicates a strong negative correlation.

Interpretation of the heatmap:

A positive correlation suggests that as the number of votes increases, the rating tends to increase. A negative correlation suggests that as the number of votes increases, the rating tends to decrease.

Histograms:

The histogram for the number of votes shows the distribution of votes across restaurants. You can observe if there are any common ranges or patterns.

The histogram for ratings provides insights into the distribution of ratings. This can help identify the most common ratings given by users.

Scatter Plot:

The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the number of votes and the ratings for each restaurant. It allows you to see if there's a trend or pattern between these two variables. Correlation Analysis:

The heatmap from the previous example gives a quantitative measure of the correlation between votes and ratings.
